Feature to automate: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1 - Exploration (Playwright Planner Agent)
Use the Playwright Planner agent with the MCP browser to:
1. Load playwright-automation-standards.m - apply locator rules throughout
2. Load banking-qa-knowledge.md - apply domain knowledge to test scenarios
3. Navigate to the application and log in using provided credentials
4. Navigate to the feature page for: $ARGUMENTS
5. Explore the feature completely - all form fields, dropdowns, buttons, flows
6. Explore both the success state and error/validation states
7. Produce a structured test plan:
    - All test scenarios for: $ARGUMENTS
    - Step-by-step actions per scenario
    - Expected outcomes per scenario
    - All selectors observed in the live DOM during exploration

## Phase 2 - Script Generation (Playwright Generator Agent)
Using the test plan and live selectors from Phase 1:
8. Generate a Page Object Model class for the feature
9. Generate a complete Playwright TypeScript spec file covering all scenarios
10. Apply CLAUDE.m financial policies to every assertion (no generic checks)
11. Add screenshot-on-failure afterEach hook
12. Externalize all credentials, amounts, and account values to a JSON test data file

## Output Files
Save spec file to:      /tests/<feature-name›spec.ts
- Save Page Object to:  /pages/<feature-name›•page.ts
- Save test data to:    /test-data/‹feature-name>.json
